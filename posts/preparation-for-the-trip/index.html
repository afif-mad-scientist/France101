Getting ready mentally, physically, financially, and administratively is something you shouldn’t skip or ignore.\nI tried to to summarize the important things for you, to help you figure out where to start in this preparation. You may notice that I insisted and put a lot of effort into the mental and emotional preparation, this is because it is really important and you should focus on it, without it you wont be able to do the rest.\nWhy you should prepare ? Preparation is not optional, it should start as soon as possible. If you wait until the last moment, you’ll feel overwhelmed as the departure date approaches, and worse you will feel lost once you arrive in France.\nMental \u0026 Emotional Preparation First you should thank God for the achievements, all the gratitude goes to him. Second, you should be proud of yourself, you made effort, struggled, and you earned your success. It isn’t that you got lucky, but it is a reward for all your hard work. So be proud, and have faithb in yourself.\nWhy Self-Confidence is Critical? All this journey you did, in fact is just the begining and the easier part. The real game is starting now. And you should believe since you’ve made it this far, you can definitely handle what’s coming. Don’t be scared, be ready.\nPreparation France is another country, a different lifestyle, different people, different mentality. You should prepare yourself that you will see things you never saw, that you will hear things you never heard, that you will feel things you never felt. So prepare yourself not to let the cultural shock catch you off guard, because believe me you will face it, like everyone did.\nIn France you will have no family, your mom and your siblings wont be with you for a long time. Expect to miss them, Expect to feel lonely, and try to enjoy the time you have left with them.\nAnother side, is about friends. In France people are different, people change, Like Dumbledore said :\n“People change in the maze. Oh, find the Cup if you can, but be very wary…you could just lose yourselves along the way.”\nSo be cautious of that, everybody can change here, no matter who he is, no matter how nice he seems, no matter how close he is. Dont trust anybody, and dont get shocked if you face such a situation. Also, try to make sure to not lose yourself too because it is really hard not to.\nIt may seem contradictory but it is not, Try to make a difference between giving help and sacrificing for someone else. At some point, everyone is responsible for himself, you are not anybody’s mother. Make it a rule, it is you first, then everyone else. This is the maze.\nAnother thing, in France you will be obliged to carry a huge amount of Responsibility. For yourself, for the money you have, for your security and safety, for many different things at the same time. So prepare yourself to not be overwhelmed by that, even if you do, and it is okey if you feel drowned, but you should be strong.\nAlso, in France you will learn a lot of life lessons, you will grow up by 10 years in just one. To learn the lessons, there two ways, by thinking and reflecting, or by making mistakes and experience. The second path is more painful. Try your best to avoid it because it could cost you a lot if you are not careful.\nSpeaking of careful, Before you make any decision, before you make any action, pause twice, breath twice, think twice, step back twice, think of all the possible ways it could go wrong, think of all the possible outcomes, then choose wisely.\nanother thing you want to prepare yourself of is about Racism. Be prepared, put in your head that you are a foreigner in a racist country, put in your head that you will be in an Islamophobic country, put in your head that you will be wearing a veil in an Islamophobic country. prepare yourself to not get hit by the sad reality when you are here.\nSpeaking of Religion. Take the time now to study your faith and understand your beliefs (aqida). If you have doubts or questions, search for answers before you go. The influence in a non-Muslim country is strong. This is a mandatory thing to do before going into a non-Muslim country. I mean what I am saying. You may say no need I already have faith, I am already convinced by the religion, NO. You should prepare yourself. I say this from experience. I’ve seen people lose themselves. Not one. Not two. Millions, people that I didnt event imagine they will. Even I was affected, not too far, but I slipped. So don’t take your faith for granted. Strengthen your foundation now.\nAlso, being a hijabi girl. in France you will be an ambassador, a representative, of the religion. It’s our duty as muslims to give a good image of the religion, so make sure to prepare yourself for that. You may even get asked about the religion by people, so you should always be prepared to give a correct answer, because you may lead that person to the good path or pushing it far from it, it’s a big responsibility.\nEverywhere, specially in France, your environnement and the people you meet will have influence on you. You may not realised it now, but you will realise it when it happens. You should always be loyal to your principals, to what you believe in. dont let the current drag you with it. It starts by simple things, by small actions that seems harmless, that seems have nothing to be worried of, but you have that feeling inside you that it is wrong. Follow yourself, dont let anyone force you and convince into anything you are uncomfortable with, because that is how it starts before things slips away.\nThere will be moments, you will feel overwhelmed, you will feel down, you feel that u need support, you feel that everything is a mess. Dont let this brings you down, prepare yourself to face such situations, and to go out from them as soon as possible. Be aware that God wont let you down and always makes a way out for you.\nThis guide is not meant to scare you. It’s all doable, just like many others before you have done. But you need to be prepared. with God’s help you will manage to do all that, in a proper way.\nPhysical Preparation Here things get more practical. Your body is you friend, if you take care of it, it will take care of you. So in the time you have left, make sure to to prepare it for what it is waiting.\nYou going to France where medical care isn’t for free and really expensive, for the first months before you get CMU. For this matter, if you have any illness, any thing that hurts you and may oblige you to go to doctor in your first 6 months, you should fix it now. If you need to go to ophtalmo, if you need to make galsses, it should be done now before going to France. Take good time to think, and try to predict all what you may need for your wellness in the first 6 moths, and do them now.\nWhen you are preparing your stuff, make in consideration to take medicines, and all what it is related (Paracetamol, aspegic, Smecta, Zandjabil, Zit 9renfel for tooth pain). Dont say that wont happen, when you are here all the improbable will happen. Even you may take a spare of glasses if you think you may break yours.\nClothing In France, it is really cold in winter. Be prepared for this cold weather. You should have with you good warm clothes, jakets, gloves, and a scarf.\nAlso have in mind that you wont buy clothes, when you arriving here, so buy everything you need now and take with you. However dont exagerate, you have a limited weight you should take that in consideration. So make sure to take only the necessary stuff.\nA good thing to take in mind are the vaccum bags, where you can put your clothes in them and suck the air from them so the clothes wont take huge volume in your luggage in case you need to.\nSpeaking of luggage, you should buy a decent big suitcase, it you dont have one. make sure it is of a good quality, becuase you will need it in all your stay in France.\nFinancial Planning In this period, be careful, if you dont plan it well, you will find yourself spending a lot of money in things you may not really need. So be wise into choosing what to buy. Yes you will spend a decent amount of money before you go, but try to make it into use, into essential stuff, that allows you to spend less money in France. Bare in mind that you need money to take with you too, so plan it well.\n[!hint] A good rule of thumb Make in your mind that you gonna leave your home in just two months, so if you gonna buy something and you gonna leave it, than there is no need to buy it\nFinancial Planning An important thing I advice you to do as well, if you can of course, is to buy a new phone as a second phone, and in the best cases the phone should have NFC and eSIM. It’s really important because as you know, your phone can stop working at anytime. And I said as a second phone, because I see it that it isn’t enough to test the new phone in such a small period of time, so it is better to take both.\nMake sure as well to have two chargers, in case you lose yours. so you wont get stuck.\nI insisted on this side for you to have a spear, because you gonna do everything through your phone, without it you wont be able to do anything.\nSIMcard is also a mendatory thing to ensure before arriving. You can choose a good offer here Forfait mobile : comparez les meilleures offres en juin 2025 . a good offer normally it’s between 7-9.99 euro for at least 100gb. To chose an offer and not get scammed bare in mind this :\nMake sure the offer is Sans engagement you should choose between these companies (Bouygues, Free, Cdiscount, Nrj, LaPosteMobile) Avoid at all cost (Lebara, Lyca) they are banned from different banks, you wont be able to use it. The SIMcard you should buy at minimum a week before your arrival, and put the address of someone that gonna meet the first day in order to give it to you. [!warning] When you put the address make sure to write the name of the person that it is written on the mailbox in the section complement d'adresse example : Complement d'adresse : Chez Name\nIn case you got a phone that has eSIM in it, make sure to choose an offer from Bouygues or Free that has eSIM. in this case you wont need the SIMcard, and you will be able to use it the second you arrive without any issue. The down side is that these two companies they rarely have good offers.\n[!hint] You are not obliged to buy the eSIM a week before, you can buy it the day before no problem.\n[!warning] Just bare in mind to not try to turn it on while you are in Algeria or you will be charged a lot. You can use the aeroport wifi to turn it on when you arrive\nAdministration Prepare all your documents that you have, you should take everything with you.\nIn Paris you should have subscription for public transport, for Student \u003c26yo you pay only 40euro/month it is called Navigo ImagineR. The process of having the card take some time, so there is two ways to not spend a lot of money for your first day in paris. In both cases you will need to make your subscription 1 month before you go to paris. [click here to know how]\n1st way You subscribe for Imagine R one month before your arrival, in your subscription you put the address of a person that will come to the aeroport and give it to you the day you arrive. This is the optimal way.\n[!warning] When you put the address make sure to write the name of the person that it is written on the mailbox in the section complement d'adresse example : Complement d'adresse : Chez Name\n2nd way You do the same procedure, but you make sure that the card wont arrive in the mailbox, either by giving them a wrong address or not writing the name of the person that will recieve it in Complement d'adresse . If the card isnt delivered in 21 days, they can give it to you the day of you arrival by going to one of their sales points present in the stations. You just present your Passport, and the Certificate of the subscription.\nVous pouvez suivre l’état d’avancement de votre demande depuis votre Espace personnel. Au-delà du délai maximal de 21 jours à compter de la réception de votre dossier complet, vous pourrez déclarer gratuitement la non-réception de votre passe imagine R : -dans les agences commerciales des transporteurs, les points de vente RATP, en Guichets Services Navigo SNCF (le passe est délivré immédiatement) ; -en ligne, depuis votre Espace personnel “Mon Navigo” » Sélectionnez le forfait concerné » dans la partie “Un problème avec mon passe de transport ?” en bas de page, cliquez sur “Non réception”. Le passe sera, selon votre choix, soit envoyé par courrier sous un délai de 7 jours ouvrés (hors délais postaux) ; soit mis à disposition immédiatement dans une agence commerciale des Transporteurs, les points de vente RATP ou en Guichets Services Navigo SNCF sur présentation d’un justificatif d’identité.\nPlane ticket The plane ticket is something you buy now because you will have no ticket left if you wait more, you should choose it carefully according to where you going to go, and if a person will wait for you that day in the aeroport. You should make sure that it is a day and a time the person will be free and has nothing to do.\nThe plane ticket One way to paris is around 20 000 dzd, no need to pay more for just a day or two in advance. you can buy the ticket in AirAlgerie website, using Dahabia.\nOrganisation Start planning your departure from now, make check lists, to not forget anything. Organise your files, your clothes, your stuff in sections, put aside everything you not planing to take. A precious advice, prepare your suitcase a week before you go, you will thank me later. because while doing so, you will realise that you forgot things, and you will avoid a huge stress the day of departure. (I wish i did that)\n![[Pasted image 20250625214256.png]]\n",

Be prepared, put in your head that you are a foreigner in a racist country, put in your head that you will be in an Islamophobic country, put in your head that you will be wearing a veil in an Islamophobic country. prepare yourself to not get hit by the sad reality when you are here.</p>
<p>Speaking of Religion. Take the time now to <strong>study your faith</strong> and understand your beliefs (<code>aqida</code>). If you have doubts or questions, search for answers <strong>before</strong> you go. The influence in a non-Muslim country is strong. This is a mandatory thing to do before going into a non-Muslim country. I mean what I am saying. You may say no need I already have faith, I am already convinced by the religion, NO. You should prepare yourself. I say this from experience. I’ve seen people lose themselves. Not one. Not two. Millions, people that I didnt event imagine they will. Even I was affected, not too far, but I slipped. So don’t take your faith for granted. Strengthen your foundation now.</p>
<p>Also, being a hijabi girl. in France you will be an ambassador, a representative, of the religion. It&rsquo;s our duty as muslims to give a good image of the religion, so make sure to prepare yourself for that. You may even get asked about the religion by people, so you should always be prepared to give a correct answer, because you may lead that person to the good path or pushing it far from it, it&rsquo;s a big responsibility.</p>
<p>Everywhere, specially in France, your environnement and the people you meet will have influence on you. You may not realised it now, but you will realise it when it happens. You should always be loyal to your principals, to what you believe in. dont let the current drag you with it. It starts by simple things, by small actions that seems harmless, that seems have nothing to be worried of, but you have that feeling inside you that it is wrong. Follow yourself, dont let anyone force you and convince into anything you are uncomfortable with, because that is how it starts before things slips away.</p>
<p>There will be moments, you will feel overwhelmed, you will feel down, you feel that u need support, you feel that everything is a mess. Dont let this brings you down, prepare yourself to face such situations, and to go out from them as soon as possible. Be aware that God wont let you down and always makes a way out for you.</p>
<p>This guide is not meant to scare you. It’s all <strong>doable</strong>, just like many others before you have done. But you need to be prepared. with God&rsquo;s help you will manage to do all that, in a proper way.</p>
<h2 id="physical-preparation">Physical Preparation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#physical-preparation">#</a></h2>
<p>Here things get more practical. Your body is you friend, if you take care of it, it will take care of you. So in the time you have left, make sure to to prepare it for what it is waiting.</p>
<p>You going to France where medical care isn&rsquo;t for free and really expensive, for the first months before you get CMU. For this matter, if you have any illness, any thing that hurts you and may oblige you to go to doctor in your first 6 months, you should fix it now. If you need to go to ophtalmo, if you need to make galsses, it should be done now before going to France. Take good time to think, and try to predict all what you may need for your wellness in the first 6 moths, and do them now.</p>
<p>When you are preparing your stuff, make in consideration to take medicines, and all what it is related (Paracetamol, aspegic, Smecta, Zandjabil, Zit 9renfel for tooth pain). Dont say that wont happen, when you are here all the improbable will happen. Even you may take a spare of glasses if you think you may break yours.</p>
<h2 id="clothing">Clothing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#clothing">#</a></h2>
<p>In France, it is really cold in winter. Be prepared for this cold weather. You should have with you good warm clothes, jakets, gloves, and a scarf.</p>
<p>Also have in mind that you wont buy clothes, when you arriving here, so buy everything you need now and take with you. However dont exagerate, you have a limited weight you should take that in consideration. So make sure to take only the necessary stuff.</p>
<p>A good thing to take in mind are the vaccum bags, where you can put your clothes in them and suck the air from them so the clothes wont take huge volume in your luggage in case you need to.</p>
<p>Speaking of luggage, you should buy a decent big suitcase, it you dont have one. make sure it is of a good quality, becuase you will need it in all your stay in France.</p>
<h2 id="financial-planning">Financial Planning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#financial-planning">#</a></h2>
<p>In this period, be careful, if you dont plan it well, you will find yourself spending a lot of money in things you may not really need. So be wise into choosing what to buy. Yes you will spend a decent amount of money before you go, but try to make it into use, into essential stuff, that allows you to spend less money in France. Bare in mind that you need money to take with you too, so plan it well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!hint] A good rule of thumb
Make in your mind that you gonna leave your home in just two months, so if you gonna buy something and you gonna leave it, than there is no need to buy it</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="financial-planning-1">Financial Planning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#financial-planning-1">#</a></h2>
<p>An important thing I advice you to do as well, if you can of course, is to buy a new phone as a second phone, and in the best cases the phone should have NFC and eSIM. It&rsquo;s really important because as you know, your phone can stop working at anytime. And I said as a second phone, because I see it that it isn&rsquo;t enough to test the new phone in such a small period of time, so it is better to take both.</p>
<p>Make sure as well to have two chargers, in case you lose yours. so you wont get stuck.</p>
<p>I insisted on this side for you to have a spear, because you gonna do everything through your phone, without it you wont be able to do anything.</p>
<p>SIMcard is also a mendatory thing to ensure before arriving. You can choose a good offer here <a href="https://lemon.fr/forfaits-mobiles-comparateur/">Forfait mobile : comparez les meilleures offres en juin 2025</a> . a good offer normally it&rsquo;s between 7-9.99 euro for at least 100gb. To chose an offer and not get scammed bare in mind this :</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the offer is <code>Sans engagement</code></li>
<li>you should choose between these companies (Bouygues, Free, Cdiscount, Nrj, LaPosteMobile)</li>
<li>Avoid at all cost (Lebara, Lyca) they are banned from different banks, you wont be able to use it.
The SIMcard you should buy at minimum a week before your arrival, and put the address of someone that gonna meet the first day in order to give it to you.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!warning]
When you put the address make sure to write the name of the person that it is written on the mailbox in the section <code>complement d'adresse</code> example :
<code>Complement d'adresse : Chez Name</code></p></blockquote>
<p>In case you got a phone that has eSIM in it, make sure to choose an offer from <code>Bouygues</code> or <code>Free</code> that has eSIM. in this case you wont need the SIMcard, and you will be able to use it the second you arrive without any issue.  The down side is that these two companies they rarely have good offers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!hint]
You are not obliged to buy the eSIM a week before, you can buy it the day before no problem.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!warning]
Just bare in mind to not try to turn it on while you are in Algeria or you will be charged a lot. You can use the aeroport wifi to turn it on when you arrive</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="administration">Administration<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#administration">#</a></h2>
<p>Prepare all your documents that you have, you should take everything with you.</p>
<p>In Paris you should have subscription for public transport, for Student &lt;26yo you pay only 40euro/month it is called Navigo ImagineR. The process of having the card take some time, so there is two ways to not spend a lot of money for your first day in paris. In both cases you will need to make your subscription <strong>1 month</strong> before you go to paris. [click here to know how]</p>
<h3 id="1st-way">1st way<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1st-way">#</a></h3>
<p>You subscribe for Imagine R one month before your arrival, in your subscription you put the address of a person that will come to the aeroport and give it to you the day you arrive. This is the optimal way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!warning]
When you put the address make sure to write the name of the person that it is written on the mailbox in the section <code>complement d'adresse</code> example :
<code>Complement d'adresse : Chez Name</code></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="2nd-way">2nd way<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2nd-way">#</a></h3>
<p>You do the same procedure, but you make sure that the card wont arrive in the mailbox, either by giving them a wrong address or not writing the name of the person that will recieve it in <code>Complement d'adresse</code> . If the card isnt delivered in 21 days, they can give it to you the day of you arrival by going to one of their sales points present in the stations. You just present your Passport, and the Certificate of the subscription.</p>
