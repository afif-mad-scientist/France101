    <description>ðŸ›« Welcome to the France Preparation Guide ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· âœ¨ Purpose of This Guide Hello and welcome!&#xA;This guide was created with one clear purpose:&#xA;To share my personal experience and advice as someone who went through this journey â€” so that you wonâ€™t have to figure it out alone.&#xA;Preparing to move to France isnâ€™t just about packing a suitcase. Itâ€™s an emotional, physical, financial, and mental transition. Iâ€™ve tried to write down everything I wish I had known, and everything I learned along the way â€” to make your own path smoother.</description>
