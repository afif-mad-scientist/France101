## ✨ Purpose of This Guide

Hello and welcome!

This guide was created with one clear purpose:  
**To share my personal experience and advice** as someone who went through this journey — so that **you won’t have to figure it out alone**.

Preparing to move to France isn’t just about packing a suitcase. It’s an emotional, physical, financial, and mental transition. I’ve tried to write down everything I wish I had known, and everything I learned along the way — to make your own path smoother.

> ✍️ Every word you’ll read here has been written intentionally.  
> **Nothing is random. Every line has a reason behind it.**  
> Please read with care — it might save you time, stress, or even pain.
